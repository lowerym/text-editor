# Text Editor

## Description
For this challenge, my task was to create a single page text editor that followed Progressive Web Application (PWA) criteria and worked offline. This application can also be downloaded and used on either your computer or mobile device outside of your browser. I used JavaScript, Webpack, IndexedDB, Node.js, and Express.js to create this application.
